1. Perform the following task using NLTK: Tokenize and tag some text, identify named entities, display a parse tree, and find the ambiguity of the sentence using parse tree.
2. Implement t-Test and Chi-Square test to check whether a given sequence of words is a collocation or not.
3. Implement decision rule-based Na√Øve Bayes disambiguation method to find the sense of an ambiguous word with the given training set.
4. Implement the Hindle and Rooth algorithm for solving the attachment ambiguity problem.
5. Implement forward and backward procedures using Hidden Markov Model to find the probability of a word sequence given a hidden Markov model.
6. Implement Viterbi algorithm to find the probability of a word sequence, and the best tag sequence using Hidden Markov Model.
7. Implement Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) and find the inside probability of a word sequence using the CYK algorithm.
8. Text Classification using Bag of Words and TF-IDF with TensorFlow.
9. Implement word2vec model to explore the semantic similarity between the words.
10. Design text generator using LSTMs. Generate the words based on the input provided by the users with available corpus.
11. Create an RNN based Python machine translation system.
